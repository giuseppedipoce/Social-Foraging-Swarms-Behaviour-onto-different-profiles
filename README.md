# Social-Foraging-Swarms-Behaviour-onto-different-profiles
#  Introduction
In this article we specify an M-member “individual-based” continuous time swarm model with individuals that
move in an n-dimensional space according to an attractant/repellent or a nutrient profile. The motion of each individual is determined by three factors: 
(i) attraction to the other individuals on long distances;\
(ii) repulsion from the other individuals on short distances;\
(iii) attraction to the more favorable regions (or repulsion from the unfavorable regions) of the attractant/repellent profile.\
The emergent behavior of the swarm motion is the result of a balance
between interindividual interactions and the simultaneous interactions of the swarm members with their environment.
